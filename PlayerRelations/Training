## Welcome

Welcome to the **Player Relations (PR) Team** of Era.

This guide covers the **core rules, expectations, tools, commands, and logging standards** you’ll use daily. You’re expected to understand it before working on tag. If you’re ever unsure, ask a **Senior PR**, the **PRA**, or a **Server Administrator**.

### Staff Definitions

- **PRA** – Player Relations Administrator (StankP / OPM)
- **Server Administrators / Managers**
  - Xaph (Manager)
  - Smogy27
  - Death Zephlyn
  - Chaingang_DX

These staff members have full server control and can assist with anything.

## Core PR Rules (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Answer ALL PMs.**  
   Even if the message is silly, respond professionally.  
   If you are busy, reply with:  
   > “Hey! I’m assisting another player right now, but I’ll help you as soon as I’m done.”

2. **Do not idle on RC or PR tag.**  
   Check PMs and chat regularly while online.

3. **Use your standard player name on PR tag.**  
   Players must recognize you at all times.

4. **Treat everyone respectfully (on or off tag).**  
   Includes PR team, RC staff, Events team, and players.  
   Staff issues go to the PRA first, then a Server Administrator.  
   Public staff arguments will not be tolerated.

5. **Leave masses ON while on tag.**  
   You are responsible for monitoring harassment, scams, and harmful content.

6. **Log ALL betspares and betflips.**  
   No exceptions.

### Consequences

- **First offense:** Warning and possible removal of rights/tools  
- **Second offense:** Demotion or removal

## Managing Uploads

PRs can approve or deny player-submitted graphics via the Support Center.  
Check uploads every time you log in.

### Upload Rules

1. **No stolen graphics.**  
   Recolored private heads, copyrighted graphics, or content from other games, websites, or media are not allowed.

2. **No existing Era items or offensive content.**  
   Heads/bodies may not include hats sold on Era.  
   No profanity, explicit nudity, or illegal content.

3. **NO real-life images.**  
   Real-life images resized for Era are strictly forbidden.  
   Uploading these results in immediate removal.

4. **If unsure, ask.**  
   Contact a Senior PR, PRA, or Server Administrator.
